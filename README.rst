Fancy Checkboxes for Markdown-IT
================================

This is a plugin for the Python implementation of Markdown-IT (a CommonMark pharser) that provides "fancy" checkboxes.

in particular, it allows you to use (almost) any character to "check" the checkbox, and then, through the use of CSS, change the displayed chrckbox. Sample CSS is included.

This is inspiried by my use of Obsidian, where many fancy checkboxes are provided by many themes. This seems to have come through imolementing things like *Bullet Journal* in Obsidian. What broughtebto create this was a desire to create a Pelican site out of my Markdown Obsidian notes.
